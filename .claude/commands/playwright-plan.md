# Playwright Test Scenario Planning

Think about the implementation differences added in this PR and the materials provided, then create a scenario test to test the frontend functionality.

Note that it may be another AI (Playwright + MCP collaboration) that runs the tests using that scenario.
Please provide a detailed test scenario in Markdown format as a prompt.

The scenario should include:
- Test objectives and expected outcomes
- Step-by-step user interactions
- Assertions to verify functionality
- Any necessary test data or setup requirements
- Edge cases and error scenarios to consider

Format the output as a structured prompt that can be directly used by Playwright MCP for test execution.
